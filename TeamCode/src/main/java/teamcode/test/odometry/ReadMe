This is for the Gluten Free iteration of Pure Pursuit
To begin, take the code in the PurePursuitGlutenFree class and make a new class in their BitBucket labelled "tutorialSeries"
Then make a new instance of the class in main (or make everything Static)
Run the sample code below in main.loop():
                ArrayList<CurvePoint> followPath = new ArrayList<>();
                followPath.add(new CurvePoint(0.0,0.0,0.5,0.3,10.0,Math.toRadians(50), 1.0));
                followPath.add(new CurvePoint(180.0,180.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,Math.toRadians(50), 1.0));
                followPath.add(new CurvePoint(220.0,180.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,Math.toRadians(50), 1.0));
                followPath.add(new CurvePoint(280.0,50.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,Math.toRadians(50), 1.0));
                followPath.add(new CurvePoint(180.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,Math.toRadians(50), 1.0));
                try {
                    movement.followCurve(followPath, 90);
                }catch (IOException e){
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
Note: Rotational component is not working, someone may want to work on that
also run in parallel with the DebugClient also provided with the Tutorial

Also the sim runs in JavaFX, which is not supported after Java 10
